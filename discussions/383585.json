GenerateDocument doesn't save the document however. So, as a workaround, you could use GenerateDocument (which returns a Document object) and then, in your LightSwitch code, use Word's Document.SaveAs method to save it to the correct format.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Steve</p>",

Could someone kindly post a few lines of sample code as to how we can save or saveas the word document that is returned by GenerateDocument?\r<br />\n<br />\nThe Office Integration Pack is very helpful and can't complain about the price, but why it has a method to save as a pdf but not a Word document is very curious. Any help here would be much appreciated. Thanks.<br />\n",

While the saveas method apparently works to save a .docx file from a source .dotx without the fileformat parameter,  that file will not open successfully in Word. (At least it wouldn't for me.) If your source for GenerateDocument is a .docx, then everything works fine without the fileformat parameter.<br />\n",
