I can split the spreadsheet up into smaller chunks and it appears to work for each chunk so it doesn't appear to be data dependent. It is a HUGE spreadsheet (746 rows by 450 columns). I only import a fraction of the columns, but the file is 1.1G. The behavior is similar but different in debug vs published app. The published app chokes on a much smaller number of rows. I was only able to import around 150 rows at a time when running the published app. It appears to be timing out on something.</p>",
