<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Overview</h1>The Office Integration Pack for Microsoft LightSwitch is a LightSwitch Extension that developers can use to add Microsoft Office integration features to their LightSwitch projects. Using the Office Integration Pack developers can import/export from Microsoft Excel, import into Microsoft Word, associate a Word template with a LightSwitch application and export data to content controls in the document, send email, and create appointments. This document describes the methods included in the Office Integration Pack.<br />
<h1>The Office Integration Pack Sample Application</h1>A sample application is available at <a href="http://officeintegration.codeplex.com/releases/87595/download/378876">http://officeintegration.codeplex.com/releases/87595/download/378876</a> that demonstrates how to use the Office Integration Pack. The comments in code are extensive and should give you a good feel for how most of the functionality works. There are many screens in the sample that demonstrate a variety of common uses of Excel, Word, and Outlook.<br /><br />The prerequisities for this sample are:<br />
<ul><li>Visual Studio LightSwitch 2011 </li>
<li>Office Integration Pack Extension </li>
<li>Microsoft Office 2010 (Excel, Word, and Outlook) </li></ul>
<br />To use the sample application, extract the contents of the ZIP and copy all the Word and Excel documents to your “My Documents” folder. Then double-click on the BookStoreApp.SLN file to open the sample in Visual Studio LightSwitch. Press F5 to compile and run.<br />
<h1>Excel Integration Features</h1>The methods in the Office Integration Pack are grouped by the Microsoft Office application to which they apply. The features related to Microsoft Excel are found in the OfficeIntegration.Excel namespace. <br />

<h1>Word Integration Features</h1>The methods in the Office Integration Pack are grouped by the Microsoft Office application to which they apply. The features related to Microsoft Word are found in the OfficeIntegration.Word namespace. 
<h2>Export</h2>The Export method exports a collection of items to a table in a Word document. Each Export overload now supports exporting of images. There are 15 overloads:<br /><b><i> Export(Collection as IVisualCollection, UseActiveDocument as Boolean) as Object </i></b>
<ul><li>Use this overload to export data to a table in a new Word document.</li>
<li>Returns an Object of type Word.Document</li>

<pre>Export(Me.Applicants, True)
</pre><br /><b><i> Export(Collection as IVisualCollection, BuildColumnHeadings As Boolean, ColumnNames As List(Of ColumnMapping), UseActiveDocument as Boolean) as Object </i></b>
